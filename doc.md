#SarthiAI development program

(A) Project overview

Hey guys, this is "s w a n a y a." I am the founder of "k e t i v e e," and I am working with my team to create AI that helps us improve our agriculture, education, medical, and space industries, as well as game studios, movie production, and entertainment industries. In this project, every AI is free to use and modify without any restrictions. The concept is to use multiple AI to achieve our goals.

(B) AI models used in the project

This project is open-source for training and integration, so anyone can contribute to developing these AIs. The AI project contains five main models to run the program.

(1) SarthiAI. Main AI to interact with users.
(2) AAdi AI. For images gen and reconciliation
(3) Yug AI. For 3d generation and environment design
(4) Arth AI. To generate audio or music and voice tone reading
(5) Ved AI. Help in mental health and other medical problems. 
(6) Parth AI. This AI is installed locally to help users resolve their problems.

(C) Traning and integration

We need a lot of data and skilled professionals to train AI models effectively. These AIs are trained and fine-tuned using custom datasets, allowing them to integrate seamlessly into a single user interface. This means users can simply ask their questions, and the AI generates the corresponding answers effortlessly.
enhancing its overall capabilities.

(D) AI models work or capability

(1) SarthiAI is based on “nlp”(natural language process). It means AI can understand and respond to the user's questions. It uses Parth AI if a user is running any programs on a local environment, to help them to resolve the problem. Talking about capabilities it can use to generate large context, code generating, document management, mathematical equations, solve complex reasoning, content analysis, medical research, space satellite analysis or testing, web-app development, game creation, agriculture improvement, and educational development, etc. 

(2) AAdi AI. This model uses SarthiAI and Yug AI to generate images and videos. The ability of AAdi is more than image generation. 
The idea is simple because Yug generates 3d items or characters So, we can generate accurate images. The problem with old AI models is that they generate 2d images because they train on 2d images. But AAdi generates 3d characters so the human face and other items can not be blurry or inaccurate. 

(3) Yug AI. We've already explored how AAdi and Yug AI work together. Yug AI specializes in generating 3D items, while AAdi provides the textures and colors, bringing those items to life with stunning visuals. What's more, Yug AI leverages real-time 3D texture mapping in software like Blender, enhancing the creative process on local machines.
With Parth AI seamlessly integrated, users get a smooth experience working on advanced 3D designs without the hassle of manual adjustments. This synergy between AI models empowers creators to achieve high-quality outputs in record time.

(4) Arth AI. Sound design has always been a challenging task, and traditional AIs tend to generate repetitive or uninspired music, often sticking to simpler, lighter melodies. But with Arth AI, we’re changing the game. Arth AI introduces advanced MIDI pattern generation and innovative song sampling that breaks the mold of conventional AI music.
And with Parth AI as a companion, creating music becomes effortless. Parth will guide users through every step of building their song, making the entire process seamless and stress-free. This combination of cutting-edge technology and ease-of-use will truly revolutionize how music is made.

(5) Ved AI, in particular, is fully trained on specialized data to recognize human facial expressions, understand various patient scenarios, and provide data to Sarthi. This helps in simplifying answers for easy comprehension by both doctors and patients, enhancing its overall capabilities.

(6) Parth AI is named with the idea that, like its namesake, it never misses its target. This AI is one of the most advanced in its class, designed to revolutionize local tasks and enhance security. It's a powerhouse of features that takes user creativity to the next level. Since it runs on local machines, users can directly interact with Parth, asking questions or requesting assistance. If Parth can’t resolve an issue locally, it securely creates an encrypted tunnel to the server to ensure any problem is quickly resolved. All server data is temporary and fully encrypted, so there’s no security risk.
Parth encrypts data on the user’s device, which can only be accessed with their permission—protected by a password or face lock, if available. It helps users learn new programs and apps by reading their screens and can even control the mouse with a virtual remote. Importantly, no data is sent to the server under these conditions. Parth also has a built-in firewall to maintain security and collaborates with Sarthi AI and other AIs to ensure the user experience is seamless.
